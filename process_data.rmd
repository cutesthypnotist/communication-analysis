Now we want to load up instructional_strategies.csv in the root and merge with subject_rounds_dt on round = round_id and task = task_id (the columns in instructional strategies will need to be renamed first)

```{r}
instructional_strategies_path <- "C:/Users/Kit/OneDrive/Communication Experiment Data/Communication Analysis/_raw data/instructional_strategies.csv"
subject_rounds_dt <- subject_rounds %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")
instructional_strategies_data <- read_csv(instructional_strategies_path, na = na_strings, show_col_types = FALSE) %>% clean_names()
instructional_strategies_data <- instructional_strategies_data %>% rename(round_id = round, task_id = task)
instructional_strategies_data_dt <- instructional_strategies_data %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")
instructional_strategies_data_dt
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged <- merge(instructional_strategies_data_dt, subject_rounds_dt, by = c("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id"), all.x = TRUE)
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged
# Rename instructional strategy values 'dir' to 'Spatial', 'min' to 'Minimal', 'Max' to 'Descriptive'
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged <- instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged %>%
  mutate(across(c("instructional_strategy"), ~str_replace_all(., c("dir" = "Spatial", "min" = "Minimal", "max" = "Descriptive"))))
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged 

# Find all NA values in gaze condition and instructional strategy
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_na <- instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged %>% filter(is.na(gaze_condition) | is.na(instructional_strategy))
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_na
# now we want to show a multi bar plot of the count of each instructional strategy within each gaze condition (on or off), so it should show on the x-axis On and Off and each bar should be the count of each instructional strategy, also the x-axis gaze group label on/off should be on the bottom)
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gaze_condition, fill = instructional_strategy)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "", x = "Gaze Condition", y = "# of Trials Where Subjects Used This Strategy") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Off" = "Gaze Off", "On" = "Gaze On"))

```


So this gives us a multi group bar chart of the count of each instructional strategy within each gaze condition, but now we want to group it further by the task type (Locate, Alignment, Task) and the task condition. The task type can be figured out from the task_id, specifically if task_id %% 3 == 1 then it is Locate, if task_id %% 3 == 2 then it is Alignment, and if task_id %% 3 == 0 then it is Match. Furthermore, thet ask_condition is already in the correct format. We will want to facet by task type and task condition.
```{r}
# Now we want to group it further by the task type and task condition
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_tt_tc <- instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged %>%
  mutate(task_id = as.numeric(task_id)) %>%

instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_tt_tc_nl
# Now we want to facet by task type and task condition, the task condition should be labelled from "Correct" to "Student was Correct after instruction"
# and "Incorrect" to "Student made an Error after instruction", also it would be easier to swap the gaze condition and task condition so the top level group is gaze and the second level group is task condition
# Now we want to group it further by the task type and task condition
instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_tt_tc <- instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged %>%
  mutate(task_id = as.numeric(task_id)) %>%

instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_tt_tc

instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_tt_tc_nl %>%
  mutate(task_condition = recode(task_condition, 
                                 "Correct" = "Student Correct", 
                                 "Incorrect" = "Student Error"),
         gaze_condition = recode(gaze_condition, 
                                 "On" = "Gaze On", 
                                 "Off" = "Gaze Off")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = task_condition, fill = instructional_strategy)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "", x = "", y = "# of Trials Where Subjects Used This Strategy") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Student Correct", "Student Error")) +
  facet_grid(task_type ~ gaze_condition) +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", angle = 45, hjust = 1),

So the instructional strategy table we want to join on anything we awnt to analyze is this one:
```{r}

Okay so a few things
- This only takes into account when the instructor started speaking and ended, not the actual duration for the task.
- Start and end are mixed up in the combined thing for some reason
- So to find the actual task times, we take the start of the task to the start of the next task except for the last one, which we try to use the round end time. Also figure out why round durations don't line up with the task durations. We can technically just look at the words files and calculate the correct time.
- Need to finish going through instructional strategies csv and segments csv to see for anomalies like wrong labels or wrong timings. 
- We only need to modify the non-classifying one, the classifying one is bad data.
- So you can use mean round durations, just keep in mind you will want to reword it later if you do change it and use this one where it would be 
- Sometimes takes into account either ratings but ALSO you need to make it not take into account the times someone spends just speaking out the prompt text as then you will actually see more extreme differences. So when you do that you should rename this to either the task durations or the duration instructor spent speaking in the TVCG paper.

Here we will want to calculate the mean duration of each round for each subject and gaze condition. We will then perform a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the mean durations between the 'Off' and 'On' gaze conditions.


--Mean Duration of Each Round by Gaze Condition

```{r}

# Step 1: Group by subject_id and round_id to get the minimum unity_log_time along with gaze_condition
round_times <- subject_ratings %>%
  group_by(subject_id, round_id) %>%
  summarise(min_unity_log_time = min(unity_log_time, na.rm = TRUE),
            gaze_condition = first(gaze_condition)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 2: Calculate the duration of each round
# We use the `lag` function to get the previous round's min_unity_log_time
round_durations <- round_times %>%
  arrange(subject_id, round_id) %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  mutate(previous_time = lag(min_unity_log_time),
         round_duration = if_else(is.na(previous_time), min_unity_log_time, min_unity_log_time - previous_time))

round_durations

mean_durations <- round_durations %>%
  group_by(subject_id, gaze_condition) %>%
  summarise(mean_duration = mean(round_duration, na.rm = TRUE))

mean_durations

# Step 4: Reshape data from long to wide format
wide_mean_durations <- mean_durations %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = gaze_condition, 
              values_from = mean_duration,
              names_prefix = "mean_duration_")

wide_mean_durations


# Assuming wide_mean_durations is already loaded with your data
# Ensure it's in the correct format
wide_mean_durations <- wide_mean_durations %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("mean_duration"), names_to = "gaze_condition", values_to = "mean_duration") %>%
  mutate(gaze_condition = sub("mean_duration_", "", gaze_condition))

# Make it a data frame
wide_mean_durations <- wide_mean_durations %>% as.data.frame()
wide_mean_durations
# Perform Wilcoxon signed-rank test using rstatix
duration_wilcox <- wide_mean_durations %>%
  rstatix::wilcox_test(mean_duration ~ gaze_condition, paired = TRUE)
duration_wilcox.p <- duration_wilcox |> add_x_position(x="gaze_condition")
duration_wilcox 
print("Z for Duration")
compute_wilcox_summary(duration_wilcox)
x_data <- wide_mean_durations %>% 
  filter(gaze_condition == "On") %>% 
  pull(mean_duration)
y_data <- wide_mean_durations %>% 
  filter(gaze_condition == "Off") %>%

z_duration <- wilcoxonZ(x = x_data, y = y_data, paired = TRUE, correct = TRUE, digits = 5)
z_duration
print(paste("Z for Duration:", z_duration))


```


So now we want similar to wide_mean_durations but we want to use instructional_strategies_data_dt_merged_tt_tc to get the mean duration of each round for each subject and gaze condition and the instructional strategy used.

So people spoke less when they saw the student's gaze. Let's see whether this made them give more 'directional' instructions. Let's first check the percentage of directional instructions.

Directional words:
- right
- left
- down
- up
- straight
- above
- below
- forward
- behind
- back
- between
- over
- under
- towards

Okay so single file test first.

```{r}

We want to do similar things for simple affirmations and negations. Let's first check the percentage of affirmations and negations.

Affirmations:
- yes
- correct
- right
- true
- sure
- okay
- yep
- yeah
- affirmative
- indeed
- absolutely
- agreed
- confirmed
- fine
- good
- great
- right
- understood
- OK
- agreed
- fine
- good

Negations:
- no
- incorrect
- wrong
- false
- not
- never
- nope
- nah

Single file test first

```{r}

subject_rounds_dt <- subject_rounds %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")
affirmations <- c("yes", "correct", "right", "true", "sure", "okay", "yep", "yeah", "affirmative", "indeed", "absolutely", "agreed", "confirmed", "fine", "good", "great", "right", "understood", "OK", "agreed", "fine", "good")
negations <- c("no", "incorrect", "wrong", "false", "not", "never", "nope", "nah", "but", "although", "however")

word_count_path <- "C:/Users/Kit/OneDrive/Communication Experiment Data/Communication Analysis/_raw data/DIB-019/word_counts.csv"
print(word_count_path)

word_count_data <- read_csv(word_count_path, na = na_strings, show_col_types = FALSE, col_types = cols(round_id = col_double(), task_id = col_double())) %>% clean_names() %>%
  mutate(subject_id = substr(subject_id, 1, 7))

# Remove start_round and end_round columns
subject_rounds_dt_word_count <- subject_rounds_dt %>% dplyr::select(-c(round_start, round_end))
word_count_data

word_count_dt <- word_count_data %>% setDT() %>% .[round_id != 0]
word_count_dt <- merge(word_count_dt, subject_rounds_dt_word_count, by = c("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id"), all.x = TRUE)

# Rename some columns back to where they were before
word_count_dt <- word_count_dt %>% .[, c("gaze_condition", "task_condition") := .(gaze_condition.x, task_condition.x)] %>%

word_count_dt

# Need to compute the task_type column based on mod
# mod 3 == 1 -> "Locate"
# mod 3 == 2 -> "Puzzle"
# mod 3 == 0 -> "Remaining"

word_count_dt <- word_count_dt %>%
  mutate(task_id = as.numeric(task_id)) %>%
  setDT() %>% 
  .[task_id %% 3 == 1, task_type := "Locate"] %>% .[task_id %% 3 == 2, task_type := "Puzzle"] %>% .[task_id %% 3 == 0, task_type := "Remaining"] %>% as.data.frame()
word_count_dt

# Now we calculate the total number of affirmations and negations for each condition
word_count_dt_grouped <- word_count_dt %>%
  group_by(subject_id, round_id, task_id, task_type, gaze_condition, task_condition) %>%

    total_affirmations = sum(count[word %in% affirmations], na.rm = TRUE),  # Total number of affirmations
    total_negations = sum(count[word %in% negations], na.rm = TRUE)  # Total number of negations
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
word_count_dt_grouped
# Now calculate the percentage of affirmations and negations for each condition
average_affirmations_negations_by_condition <- word_count_dt_grouped %>%
  group_by(subject_id, gaze_condition) %>%

    average_affirmations = mean(total_affirmations, na.rm = TRUE),
    average_negations = mean(total_negations, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
average_affirmations_negations_by_condition

```

Now we do it for all files


```{r}

subject_rounds_dt <- subject_rounds %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")
affirmations <- c("yes", "correct", "right", "true", "sure", "okay", "yep", "yeah", "affirmative", "indeed", "absolutely", "agreed", "confirmed", "fine", "good", "great", "right", "understood", "OK", "agreed", "fine", "good")

      .[, gaze_condition.y := NULL] %>%
      .[, task_condition.y := NULL] %>%
      as.data.frame()

    word_count_dt <- word_count_dt %>% relocate(gaze_condition, .after = subject_id) %>% relocate(task_condition, .after = gaze_condition) %>% relocate(round_id, .after = task_id)
    
    # Need to compute the task_type column based on mod

    word_count_dt <- word_count_dt %>%
      mutate(task_id = as.numeric(task_id)) %>%
      setDT() %>% 
      .[task_id %% 3 == 1, task_type := "Locate"] %>% .[task_id %% 3 == 2, task_type := "Puzzle"] %>% .[task_id %% 3 == 0, task_type := "Remaining"] %>% as.data.frame()
    word_count_dt
    
    # Now we calculate the total number of affirmations and negations for each condition
    word_count_dt_grouped <- word_count_dt %>%
      group_by(subject_id, round_id, task_id, task_type, gaze_condition, task_condition) %>%
      summarise(
        total_affirmations = sum(count[word %in% affirmations], na.rm = TRUE),  # Total number of affirmations
        total_negations = sum(count[word %in% negations], na.rm = TRUE)  # Total number of negations
      ) %>%
      ungroup()
    
    # Now calculate the percentage of affirmations and negations for each condition
    average_affirmations_negations_by_condition <- word_count_dt_grouped %>%
      group_by(subject_id, gaze_condition) %>%
      summarise(
        average_affirmations = mean(total_affirmations, na.rm = TRUE),
        average_negations = mean(total_negations, na.rm = TRUE)
      ) %>%
      ungroup()
    
    average_affirmations_negations_by_condition
  })
average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all
```

Now we plot it (we will want to plot affirmations and negations separately)
Let's start with affirmations

```{r}

# Now pivot it wider
average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all_wide <- average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = gaze_condition, 
              values_from = average_affirmations,
              names_prefix = "average_affirmations_") %>%
  as.data.frame()

average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all_wide

#Now we can plot the results using box and whiskers

average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("average_affirmations"), names_to = "gaze_condition", values_to = "average_affirmations") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gaze_condition, y = average_affirmations, fill = gaze_condition)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10), breaks = seq(0, 10, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Average Percentage of Affirmations by Gaze Condition", x = "Gaze Condition", y="Average Number of Affirmations") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Off" = "blue", "On" = "red"))

```

We may have a significant difference so we should test and see.


```{r}

# Now we can do the wilcoxon test
affirmations_wilcox <- average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all %>%
  rstatix::wilcox_test(average_affirmations ~ gaze_condition, paired = TRUE)
affirmations_wilcox.p <- affirmations_wilcox %>%
  add_x_position(x = "gaze_condition")
affirmations_wilcox

print("Z for Affirmations")
compute_wilcox_summary(affirmations_wilcox)

average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all

x_data <- average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all %>% 
  filter(gaze_condition == "On") %>% 
  pull(average_affirmations)
y_data <- average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all %>% 
  filter(gaze_condition == "Off") %>% 
  pull(average_affirmations)

z_affirmations <- wilcoxonZ(x = x_data, y = y_data, paired = TRUE, correct = TRUE, digits = 5)
print(paste("Z for Affirmations:", z_affirmations))

```

Looks like we have a significant difference, let's plot it.


```{r}
# Create a manual p-value annotation data frame
p_value_data <- data.frame(
  x = 1.5, 
  y = 8, 
  label = paste("p-value:", formatC(affirmations_wilcox$p, format = "f", digits = 6))
)

average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all

ggplot(average_affirmations_negations_by_condition_all, aes(x = gaze_condition, y = average_affirmations, fill = gaze_condition)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 8), breaks = seq(0, 8, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Average Number of Affirmations Per Target Set by Gaze Condition", x = "Gaze Condition", y= "Average Number of Affirmations") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Off" = "blue", "On" = "red")) +
  geom_text(data = p_value_data, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), inherit.aes = FALSE)

```

Nicer plot version

Now we do the same for negations

```

We may have a significant difference so we should test and see.

```{r}

z_negations <- wilcoxonZ(x = x_data, y = y_data, paired = TRUE, correct = TRUE, digits = 3)

Looks like we have a significant difference, let's plot it.

Key takeaways -
- People spoke less overall when they saw the student's gaze
- People needed to correct the student more when they did not see the student's gaze
- People needed to use more directional words to guide the student when they did not see the student's gaze
- People needed to use more affirmations when they did not see the student's gaze
- People looked at the student more when they did not see the student's gaze
- We found decreased usage of descriptive guidance strategies and increased usage of spatial-based and minimal guidance strategies when the student's gaze was visible.




Remove and split the next part if needed.


Load up the instructional strategies data
```{r}
# Load the instructional strategies data
instructional_strategies_path <- "C:/Users/Kit/OneDrive/Communication Experiment Data/Communication Analysis/_raw data/instructional_strategies.csv"

instructional_strategies_data <- read_csv(instructional_strategies_path, na = na_strings, show_col_types = FALSE) %>% clean_names()
# Rename round to round_id and task to task_id
instructional_strategies_data
subject_rounds_dt <- subject_rounds %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")
instructional_strategies_data_dt <- instructional_strategies_data %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")


terrain_dt <- merge(terrain_dt, subject_rounds_dt, by = c("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id"), all.x = TRUE)



```


Now we want to just do the background questionnaire data

```{r}
# Load the background questionnaire data
background_questionnaire_path <- "C:/Users/Kit/OneDrive/Communication Experiment Data/Communication Analysis/_raw data/questionnaireData.csv"

background_questionnaire_data <- read_csv(background_questionnaire_path, na = na_strings, show_col_types = FALSE) %>% clean_names()
background_questionnaire_data

# Now we just want to summarize the median age and get the count of each gender (female, male, non-binary), we also need a count of vr_experience, tutor_experience, and geology_experience, we also need the min and max age
background_questionnaire_summary <- background_questionnaire_data %>%
  summarise(
    median_age = median(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_age = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_age = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    count_female = sum(gender == "Female", na.rm = TRUE),
    count_male = sum(gender == "Male", na.rm = TRUE),
    count_non_binary = sum(gender == "Non-Binary", na.rm = TRUE),
    count_vr_experience = sum(vr_experience, na.rm = TRUE),
    count_tutor_experience = sum(tutor_experience, na.rm = TRUE),
    count_geology_experience = sum(geology_experience, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
background_questionnaire_summary

```




We now want alllllllll the plots in one place with patchwork that are in paper-friendly format so for example:
```{r duration-plot, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
# Plotting the results. We don't want the p-value label. We don't want to have the x-axis labeled as Gaze Condition. The x-axis labels should instead be "Gaze Off" and "Gaze On". We do not want the legend. We do not want the title. Finally, we want to have error bars show up as well.

wide_mean_durations
# Calculate summary statistics
summary_round_durations <- round_durations %>%
  group_by(gaze_condition) %>%
  summarise(mean_duration = mean(round_duration, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_duration = sd(round_duration, na.rm = TRUE))

summary_round_durations
# Plot using wide_mean_durations for the boxplot and jitter, and summary_mean_durations for error bars with horizontal caps
ggplot(wide_mean_durations, aes(x = gaze_condition, y = mean_duration, fill = gaze_condition)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_errorbar(data = summary_round_durations, aes(ymin = mean_duration - sd_duration, ymax = mean_duration + sd_duration, x = gaze_condition), width = 0.6, color = "black") +
  # Adding horizontal end caps
  #geom_segment(data = summary_round_durations, aes(x = as.numeric(as.factor(gaze_condition)) - 0.1, xend = as.numeric(as.factor(gaze_condition)) + 0.1, y = mean_duration - sd_duration, yend = mean_duration - sd_duration), color = "black") +
  #geom_segment(data = summary_round_durations, aes(x = as.numeric(as.factor(gaze_condition)) - 0.1, xend = as.numeric(as.factor(gaze_condition)) + 0.1, y = mean_duration + sd_duration, yend = mean_duration + sd_duration), color = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 350), breaks = seq(0, 350, 100)) +
  labs(title = "", x = "", y = "Mean Duration (in seconds)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Off" = "blue", "On" = "red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Off" = "Gaze Off", "On" = "Gaze On"))
```

```{r word-count-plot, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
# Summary statistics
word_count_by_condition_all
summary_word_count <- word_count_by_condition_all %>%
  group_by(gaze_condition) %>%
  summarise(mean_word_count = mean(total_words, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_word_count = sd(total_words, na.rm = TRUE))
average_word_count_by_condition_all
summary_word_count
word_count_by_condition_all
# Plot with errors bars
ggplot(word_count_by_condition_all, aes(x = gaze_condition, y = average_word_count, fill = gaze_condition)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  #geom_errorbar(data = summary_word_count, aes(ymin = mean_word_count - sd_word_count, ymax = mean_word_count + sd_word_count, x = gaze_condition), width = 0.6, color = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +
  labs(title = "", x = "", y = "Average Word Count") +
  theme_minimal() +

  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Off" = "Gaze Off", "On" = "Gaze On"))
```


Finally, combine with patchwork.
```{r combined-all-plots, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
```


Load all the data and combine the segments and timings into one data frame.
```{r}

# # Load the data
# directory_path <- "C:\\Users\\Kit\\OneDrive\\Communication Experiment Data\\Communication Analysis\\_raw data\\QWE-042"
# timings_path <- file.path(directory_path, "timings_updated.csv")
# segments_path <- file.path(directory_path, "segments.csv")

# timings <- read_csv(timings_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
# segments <- read_csv(segments_path, show_col_types = FALSE)

# # Process segments and join with timings
# segments_per_round <- segments %>%
#   mutate(text = tolower(text),  # Convert text to lower case
#          text = str_trim(text),  # Trim whitespace
#          text = replace_contraction(text),  # Replace contractions using textclean
#          text = str_replace_all(text, "[[:punct:]]", "")) %>%  # Remove punctuation
#   mutate(across(c(start, end), as.numeric))
  

# timings_dt <- setDT(timings)
# segments_per_round_dt <- setDT(segments_per_round) %>% .[timings_dt, on = .(start <= end, end >= start), allow.cartesian = TRUE]
# segments_per_round <- segments_per_round_dt %>% as.data.frame()
    
#   #right_join(timings, by = character()) %>%
#   #filter(start >= start.x & end <= end.x) %>%
#   #select(round, task, start = start.x, end = end.x, text)
# segments_per_round <- segments_per_round %>% relocate(round, task, start, end, text)
# # Combine text for each round and task
# combined_text_per_round <- segments_per_round %>%
#   group_by(round, task, start, end) %>%
#   summarise(combined_text = paste(text, collapse = " "), .groups = 'drop')  # Combine text entries into a single string

# combined_text_per_round
# # Save the result to a new CSV file
# #write_csv(combined_text_per_round, file.path(directory_path, "combined_text_per_round.csv"))

# # Print path to confirm where the file is saved
# #print(file.path(directory_path, "segments_per_round.csv"))

```


Now we want to do it for all the participants using map_dfr
```{r}
subject_rounds_dt <- subject_rounds %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")
combined_segments_per_round_all <- fs::dir_ls(path = path_to_files, recurse = TRUE, regexp = "[A-Z]{3}-\\d{3}\\/timings_updated.csv$") %>%
  map_dfr(.f = function(timings_updated_path) {
    print(timings_updated_path)
    segments_path <- str_replace(timings_updated_path, "timings_updated.csv", "segments.csv")
    timings <- read_csv(timings_updated_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
    segments <- read_csv(segments_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
    
    # Process segments and join with timings
    segments_per_round <- segments %>%
      mutate(text = tolower(text),  # Convert text to lower case
             text = str_trim(text),  # Trim whitespace
             text = replace_contraction(text),  # Replace contractions using textclean
             text = str_replace_all(text, "[[:punct:]]", "")) %>%  # Remove punctuation
      mutate(across(c(start, end), as.numeric))
      
    
    timings_dt <- setDT(timings)
    segments_per_round_dt <- setDT(segments_per_round) %>% .[timings_dt, on = .(start <= end, end >= start), allow.cartesian = TRUE]
    segments_per_round <- segments_per_round_dt %>% as.data.frame()
        
      #right_join(timings, by = character()) %>%
      #filter(start >= start.x & end <= end.x) %>%
      #select(round, task, start = start.x, end = end.x, text)
    segments_per_round <- segments_per_round %>% relocate(round, task, start, end, text)
    # Combine text for each round and task
    combined_text_per_round <- segments_per_round %>%
      group_by(round, task, start, end) %>%
      summarise(combined_text = paste(text, collapse = " "), .groups = 'drop')  # Combine text entries into a single string
    # Now we just want to add in the subject id to the round and task
    subject_id <- substr(basename(dirname(timings_updated_path)), 1, 7)
    combined_text_per_round <- combined_text_per_round %>% mutate(subject_id = subject_id)
    combined_text_per_round
  })
#move subject_id before round
combined_segments_per_round_all <- combined_segments_per_round_all %>% relocate(subject_id, .before = round)
combined_segments_per_round_all

# Save the result to a new CSV file
#write_csv(combined_segments_per_round_all, file.path(path_to_files, "combined_segments_per_round_all.csv"))
```

We also want to have a file that just is subject_rounds written to a csv file as that includes every subject.
```{r}
subject_rounds_dt <- subject_rounds %>% setDT() %>% setkey("subject_id", "round_id", "task_id")
subject_rounds_dt
#write_csv(subject_rounds_dt, file.path(path_to_files, "subject_rounds.csv"))
```
